      "Android Fighter is the lowest level coding game that I ever done, it is a one vs one player game and the goal is to kill the opponent.",
      "Without the help of any sort of external APIs or frameworks we had to develop it using direct access to peripherals.",
      "In order to draw the graphics in the screen (we used the \"Dual Buffering\" technic) we had to copy the content of the RAM directly to the VRAM, to move the mouse we had to collect its accelaration data and calculate its position, keyboard inputs were also subscribed and even the datetime displayed in the screen was fetched from the \"Real Time Clock\"."
